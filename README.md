## Correspondence between Henri Fantin-Latour and Otto Scholderer, 1858-1902

### Overview

The data collection consists of 306 letters and four indices. The indices serve to index persons and places as well as the works of Fantin-Latour and Scholderer mentioned in the letters. Not all persons are explicitly mentioned in the letters, i.e. by name, but it was possible to identify them in the course of the scholarly work. Accordingly, comments by the editors can be found on these mentions in the edited letters. 

Other files contain the texts displayed in perspectivia.net on the introduction and the procedure of the scholarly edition, as well as the table of contents and other textual elements of the online presentation. 

### Indices
The four indices are available as individual files in .csv (comma separated values) format, and also summarised as sheets in an Excel table document.
